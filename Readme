The authorization decryption scheme is implemented by combining SM2 algorithm and Schnorr signature algorithm.

The GenerateFile class is used to generate different file sizes.
ECISchnorr class implements the logic of each algorithm in the scheme.
The TestECISchnorr class is used to test the execution time of individual algorithms.
